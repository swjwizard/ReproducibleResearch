Reading the Activity file.  It is in a CSV format, has a header, and is comma seperated.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
fitnessData = read.table("activity.csv", sep=",", header = TRUE)
```

Histogram on the total number of steps taken each day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
stepSums <- tapply(fitnessData$steps, fitnessData$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
with (fitnessData, hist(stepSums, main = "Histogram of Steps per Day",
        ylab = "Frequency", xlab = "Number of Steps", breaks = 10))
```

Calculate the Mean and Median of steps per day.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(stepSums)
median(stepSums)
```

Average daily activity pattern

```{r, echo=TRUE}
fiveMinAvg <- tapply(fitnessData$step, fitnessData$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
with (fitnessData, plot(interval[1:288], fiveMinAvg, type = "l",
      main = "Average Steps by across Days", ylab = "Average Steps",
      xlab = "5 Minute Intervals"))
maxSteps <- max(fiveMinAvg)
index <- match(maxSteps, fiveMinAvg)
maxRecord <- fiveMinAvg[index]
maxInterval <- as.numeric(names(maxRecord))
maxInterval
```

Calculating the number of missing values
```{r, echo=TRUE}
missingVals <- is.na(fitnessData[, 1])
numOfNA <- sum(missingVals)
numOfNA
```

This is the end.
